# What's New In C# 7


*Presented at TechBash 2016*





## Abstract


Go (or commonly referred to as GoLang) is a powerful C-like open source programming language featuring a (relatively) clean syntax. Originally created by Google. It is supported by an ever growing community and popularized by projects such as Docker. In this session, we'll take a tour of Go's most defining language features and 'out of the box' dev tools. You'll learn about Go's object and concurrency models while seeing how the dev tools assist with code formatting, testing, benchmarking, and diagnostics such as race detection.
