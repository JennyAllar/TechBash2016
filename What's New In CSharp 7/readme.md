# What's New In C# 7

*Presented at TechBash 2016*



## Abstract

It's never been a more exciting time to be a C# developer as the language has shifted from being a proprietary Microsoft technology to an open source project with a new modern compiler service which makes it easier and quicker to add new features. C# 7 builds on this framework to bring us new syntax for working with data structures in a more functional-like and friction-less way, allowing us to reduce our boiler plate code and more clearly express our intent.



In this session, you'll learn the new C# 7 syntax through code demos and see how the new features such as tuples and pattern matching can help simplify common coding patterns.

## Code Prerequisites

The source code for this presentation was written for [Visual Studio 15 Preview 4](https://www.visualstudio.com/visual-studio-pre-release-downloads/). It will not work in older versions and may not work in newer versions, as the language features for C# 7 are still being developed.
